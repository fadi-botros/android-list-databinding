# android-list-databinding
A small try to learn and demonstrate how to use android databinding library with ObservableList s

# What it demonstrate
- Use of databinding itself
- MVVM (with (I think) a close try to fully isolate models from views)
- Different ViewModel s to the same list, each one views the list from a different point of view
- Change in model (the individual and the list) itself must be reflected in ALL views according to the point of view
- Use of custom listeners in databinding library
- ConstraintLayout as a side thing to demonstrate and learn

# What to do next
- Fix some errors
- Divide the code into different packages
- Use generics more effectively instead of just constant types and using of the Object type itself
- Generalize it and make it a library
